# Theme

Tweaked version of Hydeout for my journal. If you like it,
you're welcome to use it however you want.

Forked from [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout).

# Installation

You should be able to clone this repo and use as is. For the latest
version, try installing Hydeout and then replacing the files in my
diffs.
